Hello nathros,

I didn't see any other way to send you a message. Your contact form on your AWS page (q6hkaaeqd1.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com) is not working. You can't leave comments either and you have disabled messages on your GitHub account. That's why my last attempt to establish contact here.

I found your flatmount adapter for torque support for the Rohloff. Super nice implementation and the bike on the adapter is a blast. Well done!

I am facing the same problem as you. I have a flatmount frame and want to install a Rohloff, but there is still no suitable bone from Rohloff for the flatmount mount.

I'm glad I found your project and wonder if you designed and milled the adapter yourself? What material is it made of?

I hope you can help me with my problem as unfortunately I have no experience with 3D designs. I would appreciate any help you could give me. At the moment I don't know how I can save my project, because without a suitable adapter it is on the brink of collapse.

Thank you in advance!


Greetings
Jens
